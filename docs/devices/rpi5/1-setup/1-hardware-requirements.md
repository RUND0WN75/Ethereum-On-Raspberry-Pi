## Hardware requirements

To run an **Ethereum Node** on Raspberry Pi 5, you will need

- 1 x [Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)](https://botland.store/raspberry-pi-5-modules-and-kits/23905-raspberry-pi-5-8gb-5056561803326.html) with [Active colling](https://botland.com.pl/elementy-montazowe-raspberry-pi-5/23925-raspberry-pi-active-cooler-aktywne-chlodzenie-radiator-wentylator-do-raspberry-pi-5-5056561803357.html)
- 1 x 2TB SSD drive (external USB SSD or NVMe m.2 with adapter) 
- 1 x SD Card reader/writer 
- 1 x [microSD Card](#fast-sd-cards)
- 1 x [Power supply](https://botland.store/raspberry-pi-5-power-supply/23907-raspberry-pi-27w-usb-c-power-supply-official-51v-5a-psu-for-raspberry-pi-5-black-5056561803418.html)
  
## Details

### Storage
2 TB fast drive is required. 
With Raspberry Pi 5 you have three options for storage:
- external USB SSD drive (wide availability)
- m.2 NVMe drive with NVMe HAT for Raspberry Pi 5 (max performance)
- m.2 NVMe drive with USB m.2 adapter 

Raspberry Pi 5 has a PCIe x1 connector on board so with a special adapter m.2 NVMe drive can be used.
This option gives the maximum possible performance.

If you use USB always choose USB 3.0 ports (blue ones).

### Power supply
As a power supply, we recommend an [official PSU 5,1V / 5A](https://botland.store/raspberry-pi-5-power-supply/23907-raspberry-pi-27w-usb-c-power-supply-official-51v-5a-psu-for-raspberry-pi-5-black-5056561803418.html) for Raspberry Pi 5.
Raspberry Pi 5 + 2TB drive can use a significant amount of power so a sufficient power supply is important for stability.

### Cooling
Active cooling is required to avoid throttling and keep sufficient performance/stability of the system.

### microSD Cards

Flashing a microSD card takes time, but it can be reduced by using a fast device. Additionally, using a fast micro SD card results in a shorter booting time. A few examples:
