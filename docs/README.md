## Getting started

An **Ethereum Node** can be deployed and hosted on a device (or devices) in multiple ways. To quickly configure the node, follow the provided instructions.

## Device generations

A few generations of Raspberry Pi devices allow running an **Ethereum Node**. Each generation may be configured in multiple ways, resulting in many options to follow.

### Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB)

The most straightforward configuration to run a Raspberry Pi 4-based setup requires two **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** (8GB) devices acting as a single **Ethereum Node**. Follow the [Raspberry Pi 4 quick start guide](./devices/rpi4/README.md) to configure and run the node.
