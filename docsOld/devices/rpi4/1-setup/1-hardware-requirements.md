Available for purchase as a [botland starter kit](https://botland.store/raspberry-pi-4b-modules-and-kits/16850-justpi-starterkit-with-raspberry-pi-4b-wifi-8gb-ram-32gb-microsd-accessories-case-with-two-fans-5903351242714.html).

_If starter kit is not available for immediate delivery you can always order above parts separately._

### LAN Switch

LAN switch is used to register both devices in the same subnetwork. For example:

- [tp-link switch](https://www.tp-link.com/home-networking/soho-switch/tl-sg1005d/) with 5 ports
- Optional [LAN cable](https://botland.store/utp-cat-5e/14372-lanberg-ethernet-patchcord-utp-5e-2m-grey-5901969404449.html) to connect the switch to the router

### Fast Micro SD Cards

Flashing an micro SD card takes time, but it can be reduced by using a fast device. Additionally, using a fast micro SD card results in a shorter booting time. A few examples:
